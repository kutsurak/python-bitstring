*python* _pī'thŏn', n._ a large snake that crushes its victims: a dynamic object-oriented programming language.

*bitstring* _bit-string, n._ a sequence of binary digits.

The complete documentation for the bitstring module is now available as a PDF. This contains all the information that was in the Wiki, which is now deprecated. This document isn't included in the 0.4.2 release from the Downloads tab (because I hadn't written it at the time) but will be part of future releases.
