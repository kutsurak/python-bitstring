CLASSES

    class BitString(__builtin__.object)
     |  A class for general bit-wise manipulations and interpretations.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __add__(self, bs)
     |      Concatenate BitStrings and return new BitString.
     |

     |  
     |  __and__(self, bs)
     |      Bit-wise 'and' between two BitStrings. Returns new BitString.
     |      
     |      bs -- The BitString (or string for 'auto' initialiser) to & with.
     |      
     |      Raises ValueError if the two BitStrings have differing lengths.
     |  
     |  __contains__(self, bs)
     |      Return whether bs is contained in the current BitString.
