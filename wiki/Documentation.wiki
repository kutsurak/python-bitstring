_A Python module to help you manage your bits_

The complete documentation for the bitstring module is now available as a PDF. This contains all the information that was in the Wiki, which is now deprecated. This document isn't included in the 0.4.2 release from the Downloads tab (because I hadn't written it at the time) but will be part of future releases.
