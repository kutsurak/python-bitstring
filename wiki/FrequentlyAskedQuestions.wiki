_disclaimer_: None of these questions have really been frequently asked. I'm just making it up. If you have a real question then please ask it; either directly to me (scott@griffiths.name) or in the comment section below.

===How well optimised is the code? Are you planning to port to C?===

The module is pure Python at the moment, and I've got no plans to move any of it to C. That may change in the future, but it isn't a priority right now. Attention has been paid to using the right algorithms to maximise the speed, and I have some grand plans for further algorithmic improvements in the medium term. If you have a particular case that you think is unreasonably slow then please tell me about it.

===When is it coming out of beta?===

October 9th 2009. :-)

The current version is 'production/stable'. This means that you can expect the API to remain stable for the whole of version 1. There will still be new features, but I'll try really hard not to break backwards compatibility.

There will be a version 2 some time in 2010. This won't be a radical revision, but will tweak a few bits of the interface. See the 2.0 Milestone items in the Issues tab for the current candidate changes.

===Will Python 2.4 and 2.5 continue to be supported?===

The versions after 1.0 have been for Python 2.6 or later only. This has allowed a number of simplifications, including having just one code-base for Python 2.6 and 3.x.

There may be future releases for Python 2.4 and 2.5 (beyond bug fixes) but it's quite possible that there won't be. The work needed to make a new release is considerable and as I estimate over 90% of people are using the newer Python versions I'm not convinced it is time well spent.

----

===Are you going to introduce feature X?===

That depends. If you have any feature requests then please take a look at the Issues tab, and if it's already there add a comment to say you want it, and if it's not then add a new issue. I am open to suggestions.

----

===Do you have a feature roadmap?===

Not really, but you can get a good idea of the future direction by looking through the open enhancement requests on the Issues tab.
