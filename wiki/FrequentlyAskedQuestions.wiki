_disclaimer_: None of these questions have really been frequently asked. I'm just making it up. If you have a real question then please ask it; either directly to me (scott@griffiths.name) or in the comment section below.

===How well optimised is the code? Are you planning to port to C?===

The module is pure Python at the moment, and I've got no plans to move any of it to C. That may change in the future, but certainly won't happen before it comes out of beta. Attention has been paid to using the right algorithms to maximise the speed, and I have some grand plans for further algorithmic improvements in the medium term. If you have a particular case that you think is unreasonably slow then please tell me about it.

===When is it coming out of beta?===

Probably in October 2009.

===What's the deal with Python 3 support?===

I made a port of version 0.4.0 to Python 3 as an experiment, partly to see how much demand there would be. The answer is not a lot - I estimate that there have been twenty Python 2 downloads per Python 3 download. As there's only one of me and my time is precious I haven't ported any later versions, but I am planning to do so when I get to version 1.0.

There will probably be a port of version 1.0 appearing in October 2009.

===Will Python 2.4 and 2.5 continue to be supported?===

Yes, until at least version 1.0. I am very tempted to drop support for older Python versions after this point because there are lots of simplifications I can make using newer Python 2.6 syntax and features, plus this will ease the transition to Python 3.

----

===Are you going to introduce feature X?===

That depends. If you have any feature requests then please take a look at the Issues tab, and if it's already there add a comment to say you want it, and if it's not then add a new issue. I am open to suggestions.

----

===Do you have a feature roadmap?===

Not really, but you can get a good idea of the future direction by looking through the open enhancement requests on the Issues tab.
