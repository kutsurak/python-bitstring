= Introduction =
The bitstring module is a pure Python module designed to allow binary data to be read, interpreted, created and modified with as much ease as possible.

A single class, `BitString`, is provided that stores the binary data and offers a rich variety of methods for all your binary needs.

{{{
from bitstring import BitString

# Lots of ways of creating BitStrings
a = BitString('0b001')                     # from a binary string
b = BitString('0xff470001')                # from a hexadecimal string
c = BitString(filename='somefile.ext')     # straight from a file
d = BitString(int=540, length=11)          # from an integer

# Easily construct new BitStrings
e = 5*a + '0xcdcd'                         # 5 copies of a followed by two new bytes
e.prepend('0b1')                           # put a single bit on the front
f = e[7:]                                  # cut the first 7 bits off
